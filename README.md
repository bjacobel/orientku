Orientku
=========
Inspired by the New York Times' April Fools Day joke-cum-tech-art-project, I've done the same for the venerable publication closest to my heart, the [@bowdoinorient].

System
----------
Specifics are still hazy. A master script (Python maybe, I haven't decided yet) uses the Orient API to pull article content from bowdoinorient.com as it's published. It's parsed in Python using [haikufinder], then sent to Twitter via Ruby and [t]. Find the beautiful, poetic results at [@orientku].
